## Overview
Project made at CFA focused on connecting NodeJS backend/API with React frontend. Primarily worked on accessing API URL endpoints to perform GET/POST/DELETE functions through axios. Had more practice with props, this, and state.
Changed a component image based on a state in previous file.
